# Project Planning
The project our groups has chosen is a website that will allow athelets to schedule amateur sporting events in their own community. It will be a way for members to connect, and inform each other about games that they are organizing at a particular venue. By logging on, users can get a listing of events, including time and place, as well as what sport is being played. The event organizer can inform anyone interest what kind of equipment is needed for the event. Members will have a concise, easy-accessable means to find and create sporting events in their area. The application will greatly reduce the time and trouble required to arrange frequent sporting events, and help people connect with other players that may have never met otherwise.
